<p>2. I understand that this project is for research purposes only and not for treatment.</p>
<p>3. In this project, I will be required to complete a computer-based task, a handedness questionnaire, some questions about how I am feeling and a simple 30 second activity (e.g., squeezing an object or sitting quietly). The details of this have been explained in the Plain Language Statement. </p>
<p>4. My participation is voluntary, and I am free to withdraw from the project at any time without explanation or prejudice and to withdraw any unprocessed data I have provided.
