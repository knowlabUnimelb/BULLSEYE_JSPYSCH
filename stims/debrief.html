<h3>Thank you for completing this experiment</h3>

<p>Thank you for participating in a project on the effect of non-dominant hand contraction (NDHC) on performance under pressure. You performed two conditions: an accuracy condition, where you were told to click the bullseye as accurately as possible, and a speed condition, where you were told to click the bullseye as fast as possible.</p>

<p>In some conditions, participants were asked to make NDHCâ€™s between the accuracy and speed blocks. In other conditions, participants were asked to sit quietly. You would have been in one of these two conditions. </p>

<p>Previous research has found that making NDHCs benefits later performance in complex motor activities, specifically various sporting activities. This research aims to find if the same beneficial after-effects of NDHCs can be found during the completion of simple computer-based motor task performed under time pressure. </p>

<p>Your participation will contribute towards the current knowledge of sports and performance psychology. This will benefit the community with an increased understanding of ways to improve performance of simple and complex motor activities under time pressure and the underlying mechanisms that allow for such improvement. </p>

<p>If you would like to be contacted regarding the results of the study, or withdraw any data you have provided at any time in the experiment, you may contact the researchers listed above. </p>

<p>We understand that participation in this study might have caused some discomfort or anxiety. If your mood, self-esteem, or psychological state has been negatively affected as a result of your participation, you may contact the researchers listed above for support as needed. There are also counselling services such as Lifeline (13 11 14) and the University of Melbourne Psychology Clinic (Tel: +61 3 9035 5180; email: clinic@psych.unimelb.edu.au).  </p>
