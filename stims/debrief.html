<h3>Thank you for completing this experiment.</h3>

<p>Thank you for participating in a project on the effect of non-dominant hand contraction (NDHC) on performance under pressure. You performed two conditions: an accuracy condition, where you were told to click the bullseye as accurately as possible, and a speed condition, where you were told to click the bullseye as fast as possible.</p>

<p>In some conditions, participants were asked to make NDHC’s between the accuracy and speed blocks. In other conditions, participants were asked to sit quietly. You would have been in one of these two conditions. </p>

<p>Previous research has found that making NDHCs benefits later performance in complex motor activities, specifically various sporting activities. This research aims to find if the same beneficial after-effects of NDHCs can be found during the completion of simple computer-based motor task performed under time pressure. </p>

<p>To increase pressure, you were shown scoreboards during the experiment. These scoreboards were fake and not a reflection of your true performance.  In some conditions, there was a $100 gift voucher which we told you would be awarded to the top performance. The gift voucher will be awarded to the participant with the highest average accuracy in the speeded response condition; however, since the scoreboard is not an accurate reflection of performance, participants would not have been aware that they were performing well. </p>

<p>The purpose of the deception was to increase the pressure you felt in the experiment. In past experiments, NDHC’s have been shown to improve performance only in high pressure conditions. The leaderboard was designed to bring good and poor performance to the attention of participants; however, we did not let any participant believe that they were the top performer to increase the motivation to do well. </p>

<p>We understand that deception might cause you some frustration. We would like to apologise for this deception, and we would like to give you the opportunity at this stage to withdraw your data from our research. If you choose, to remove your data, please contact the researchers above, and we will delete your data; otherwise, we will maintain your anonymous data for our analysis.</p>

<p>In some conditions, participants were also observed by the experimenter via Zoom. This was also done to increase the pressure of performing the task accurately, even in the speeded condition, and to make sure that you followed instructions properly.</p>

<p>Your participation will contribute towards the current knowledge of sports and performance psychology. This will benefit the community with an increased understanding of ways to improve performance of simple and complex motor activities under time pressure and the underlying mechanisms that allow for such improvement. </p>

<p>If you would like to be contacted regarding the results of the study, or withdraw any data you have provided at any time in the experiment, you may contact the researchers listed above. </p>

<p>We understand that participation in this study might have caused some discomfort or anxiety. If your mood, self-esteem, or psychological state has been negatively affected as a result of your participation, you may contact the researchers listed above for support as needed. There are also counselling services such as Lifeline (13 11 14) and the University of Melbourne Psychology Clinic (Tel: +61 3 9035 5180; email: clinic@psych.unimelb.edu.au).  </p>
