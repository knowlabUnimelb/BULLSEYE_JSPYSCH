<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>We would like to invite you to participate in our study on how accurately and/or quickly people can perform simple hand movements.</p>

<h3>What I will be asked to do?</h3>

<p> Should you agree to participate, you will complete a simple computer-based task, involving several blocks of trials. At the start of each trial, a small cross will be presented onscreen (a cue) alerting you to the start of the trial. Following the cue, a target will be presented on-screen (a bullseye). Your task will be to make a mouse click as close as you can to the middle of the bullseye. On some occasions, you will be asked to do a short 30 second activity before doing a block of the bullseye task. We will also check in from time to time to see how youâ€™re feeling with a few survey questions. Further instructions will be provided onscreen once you start the experiment. <br><br>

On each trial, your response and the time required to make your response will be recorded. <br><br>

In addition to the computer task outlined above, we will also get you to complete a questionnaire to check which hand is your dominant hand. Your performance data and responses to survey questions will be used later for data analysis.<br><br> 

The experiment involves one session of approximately 20-30 minutes in duration. Testing for each session will be conducted online through your own computer. <br><br>

You will be reimbursed for your time depending on the length of the experiment. You will be reimbursed 1 REP credit for the experimental session. <br></p> 

<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<p>The experiment requires some repetition over an extended period of time (not more than 30 minutes per session), but there are breaks at regular intervals, and we recommend that you take advantage of those breaks to ensure that you can remain motivated throughout the task. </p>

<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
<p>This experiment will further our understanding of performance under pressure. You will receive one REP credit for your participation.</p>

<h3>How will my confidentiality be protected?</h3>
<p>This is an anonymous study. We will protect the confidentiality of your responses to the fullest possible extent within the limits of the law. In order to protect your identity, you will be given an experimental number and any references to personal information which might allow someone to guess your identity will be removed. Your name and contact details will be stored in a password-protected computer file. Your name and contact details will only be able to be linked to your responses by the investigators named above.  <br><br>

We anticipate making the de-identified data from this research series open-source on a public repository for the purposes of replication and open science. </p>

<h3>What if I want to withdraw from the Research?</h3>
<p>Participation in this research is completely voluntary. You are free to withdraw at any time without prejudice and to withdraw any unprocessed data previously supplied. This will have no effect on your relationship with any member of the School of Psychological Sciences. It will not affect your grades, assessment or any treatment that you would otherwise be eligible for.</p>
